# comp 1238

***

## week 1 - history
- Sumerian clay tablets represent the oldest known writing
- Babylonian cuneiform numerals use base-60
- You can use the base-12 system using your fingers phalanges(phalanxes?)
- Gutenberg!
- TIL sans-serif meant "without the 'tippy' things on letters"

## week 2 - bits and bytes
- Bits, NIBBLES & Bytes (1, 4, 8)
- I don't think I'll be able to learn morse code ðŸ˜¦
- Binary / Decimals / Hexadecimal conversions are tough... or so I thought

## week 3 - text structure
- ASCII art is better with monospaced fonts
- Gettig started with markdown
- Also getting familiar with git and github.  Still a beast but it's super convenient!

## week 4 - keyboards and editors
- efficient typing reduces cognitive load.  THIS IS A REMINDER FOR ME TO REPLACE THE N & / SWITCH ON MY MECHANICAL KEYBOARD
- I still don't know if VScode is a text editor an IDE
- I'm good with regex learning until I get into the realm of lookahead/lookbehind

## week 5 - cli
- grep = global regular expression print. I need to learn some more.
- Try not to get too obsessed with CLI games shown this week. My steam library will cry. 
- This week's lab will help me figure out markdown some more. Let's try to go beyond lists
- [x] done
